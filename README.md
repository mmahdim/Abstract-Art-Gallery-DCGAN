# Abstract Art Gallery DCGAN
 Using DCGAN to generate abstract art
 In this project, the aim is to produce abstract art similar to the ones in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bryanb/abstract-art-gallery using Keras.

 The first python notebook is just a plain DCGAN.
 The second one is DCGAN with noise added to the discriminator in order to improve convergance.
 The third one which performs the best utilizes Wasserstein loss function, and it mitigates mode collapse and vanishing gradient
